# Deep_Learning_HPC

# TASK

1. Palmetto Cluster and Setup


2. Training a Pytorch deep learning model on Palmetto cluster

3. Modify the code for better performance (use two GPUs).

torch.cuda.device_count() returned number of GPU available
picture 3,4,5, 6

Increasing Accuracy : Alexnet pretrained was used for better performance with batch size 256, SGD optimizer and 100 epochs.

# Results
There are 10 total classes, and the top10_inds variable gives me the indices of the 10 classes along with their values in percentage.

Result: The category 5 that belongs to DOG in Cifar 10 was predicted correctly.

# First Result 
13 14



# Second Result 
Result The category 1 that belongs to CARS was predicted by the model with test accuracy = 90.39%.

# Steps
1. Jupyter Notebook setup https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/

2. Create a Conda virtual environment in the terminal using module add anaconda3/5.1.0

3. environment, once created/modified is saved and can be accessed later through the code:
    conda create -n NAME_OF_ENV python=3.5 # (Create Environment)
    source activate NAME_OF_ENV # (Activate Environment)
    source deactivate NAME_OF_ENV # (Deactivate Environment)
    
4. Install necessary packages in the terminal
    CUDA module add cuda-toolkit/10.0.130
    CuDNN module add cuDNN/10.0v7.4.2
    
 5. CUDA 10.1
conda install pytorch==1.5.1 torchvision==0.6.1 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch

6. Training deep learning model for Image Classification
   a. Load the training and test datasets from torchvision
  Training Data can be obtained from various online sources, self-procured or can even be imported from a library
  Pytorch. https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html
  
    b. 	Define a Convolutional Neural Network https://medium.com/@RaghavPrabhu/understanding-of-convolutional-neural-network-cnn-deep-learning-99760835f148
  
   c. Define a loss function https://algorithmia.com/blog/introduction-to-loss-functions
   d.  Train the network on the training data with different number of Epochs https://towardsdatascience.com/epoch-vs-iterations-vs-batch-size-4dfb9c7ce9c9 


7.  Monitor the usage info of GPU and GPU memory: nvidia-smi â€“l


# Dependencies
1. Multiple GPU
2. CUDA 11
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Python 3.6
5. pytorch
6. Cifar https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
